# GSIV23 Frontend Interview Assignment

The project is built from vite.
Commands:
`run: npm run dev
build: npm run build`

## Feature Implemented

- Debounce on search functionality for smooth experience.
- New Redux Toolkit with createAsyncThunk for async operation


## Challenges

- Search on debounce was a bit difficult as I'd to manage pagination as well.
- If I'd few more hours I could have refactored the code and shimmer effect.
